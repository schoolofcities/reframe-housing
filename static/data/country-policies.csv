Singapore,Doing,The Housing and Development Board (building and managing),Owner-occupied flats on 99-year leases,"Singapore is a textbook example of government-led housing provision, employing subsidies and strong resale regulations. Approximately 80% of housing in Singapore is built and managed by the HDB, with 99-year leases ensuring the government can reclaim the land at the end of the lease term"
Austria,Both,Large-scale municipal housing and subsidies for [limited-profit housing associations](https://www.housinginternational.coop/members/osterreichischer-verband-gemeinnutziger-bauvereinigungen-revisionsverband-austrian-federation/),"Mixed-income rental housing, long-term affordability, strong tenant protections","Austria’s housing system is often cited as an ideal model for Western countries to follow. Nearly 60% of the country’s residents live in municipal housing estates, supplemented by a robust limited-profit housing model operated by Gemeinnützige Bauvereinigungen (GBVs) which provides cost-based affordable housing to both renters and owners."
Netherlands,Paying (and regulating),"Semi-public social housing corporations, rent allowances","Low- and middle-income rental housing, strong tenant protections","The Dutch government utilizes a number of creative mechanisms to pay for and encourage the creation of affordable housing. This includes social housing overseen by heavily regulated housing associations, mandatory affordable housing permits for mid-market rentals, government funding and loan guarantees for new construction, and recently – the Affordable Rent Act to control mid-market rents."
Sweden,Both,"Municipal housing corporations, subsidies, planning mandates","Universal rental housing, social integration","Sweden has a notable history of public housing provision that began in 1965 with its ambitious Million Homes Program, a 10-year plan that constructed over one million homes owned by municipalities and cooperatives. Despite moving away from direct subsidies in the 1990s, Sweden maintains a partnership-driven universal approach that integrates housing provision with land use and fiscal policy to address all households’ needs."
South Korea,Both,"State-led development, rental programs, supply-side subsidies","Ownership, long-term rental housing for low- and middle-income households","South Korea has taken strong actions to increase housing affordability since the 1970s, mainly through increased supply. This began with policies like the 1973 Housing Construction Promotion Act, which promoted provision of “national housing” using government funds, and continued through the Korean Land Corporation. Through these and other measures, the government helped effectively triple the country’s housing stock between 1975 and 2010, with the number of housing units per 1,000 people in the Greater Seoul Metropolitan Area [increasing from 137 in 1975 to 364 in 2010.](http://nationalatlas.ngii.go.kr/pages/page_1295.php)"
United States,Paying,"Indirect subsidies, tax credits (LIHTC), Section 8 vouchers, limited public housing","Targeted affordability for low-income renters, reliance on private developers","In the 1970s, the United States made a dramatic shift from large-scale public housing provision toward a market-based system of incentives and subsidies. Public housing has been systematically underfunded and often stigmatized, which has led to a declining stock and existing units falling into disrepair. Current policy relies heavily on private-sector mechanisms such as the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) and Section 8 vouchers, which aim to support affordability without direct public construction."
Canada,Mostly paying,"Federal/provincial transfer programs, subsidies, non-profit partnerships, tax incentives","Affordable rentals, homelessness programs, Indigenous housing","Canada’s postwar housing system included large-scale federal and provincial investment in non-profit and co-operative housing, which expanded significantly throughout the 1960s and 70s. Beginning in the 1990s, however, the federal government largely withdrew from direct housing provision, leaving provinces and municipalities with uneven resources to address growing affordability needs. In recent years, Canada has re-entered the housing field through the National Housing Strategy, explicitly emphasizing funding for non-profit and Indigenous housing, as well as targeted rent supplements."
United Kingdom,Paying,"Semi-private housing associations, right-to-buy","Affordable rent, homeowner support","The U.K. built one of the largest public housing systems in the immediate post-war period, with “council housing” providing affordable homes across income groups. The right-to-buy policy of the 1980s sold off a substantial portion of this stock, marking a sharp turn toward privatization and reduced government provision. Today, housing associations, supported through public subsidies and planning mandates, deliver most affordable housing – though critics argue that affordability has been diluted compared to the previous model."
Australia,Mostly paying,"Rent assistance, modest subsidies for community housing","Homeownership incentives, some public housing","Australia was once known for its heavy investment in public housing, reaching peak construction in the mid-20th century. Since the 1980s though, public housing has steadily declined and now only represents a fraction of the country’s total housing stock. Affordable housing provision today centres on the National Housing Accord: an ambitious plan that brings together all levels of government, industry, and investors to deliver 20,000 new social and 20,000 affordable homes over 5 years."
New Zealand,Both,"State housing, income-based rent subsidies, non-profit/community partnerships","Targeted social housing, homeownership support","Once a world leader in mass public housing post-WWII, New Zealand saw a retreat from public housing in the 80s-90s that paralleled other Western democracies undergoing neoliberal reforms. Now experiencing an affordability crisis of its own, New Zealand provides grants to non-profits through an Affordable Housing Fund, as well as supporting first-time homeowners through grants and loans."
